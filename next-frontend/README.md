# 🎯 Eventful India — Frontend Next.js Developer Test Assignment

Hi Team 👋,

This is my submission for the **Frontend Next.js Developer Test Assignment** for Eventful India.

> ✅ TL;DR: I’ve implemented **every single requirement** from the assignment PDF — clean, fully responsive, production-ready. Check the live demo and code below.  
> I even added bonus features like **Redux-based login** with **global state management** and **route protection** for the dashboard. 🤘

## 🚀 Live Demo

🌍 **Deployed on Vercel:** [https://eventful-india-demo.vercel.app](https://eventful-india-demo.vercel.app)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** (100% utility-based styling)
- **Redux Toolkit** – for login and global auth state management
- **React Hook Form + Yup** – for form validation
